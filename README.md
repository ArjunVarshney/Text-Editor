# Text Editor

This is a basic text editor which can be used to take notes and print it also. I have used `quill` in this application for formatting the text in the editor box.
The text stores in the local storage in realtime hence when reloaded, the data restores.
I find this editor very usefull for my- self as it acts as a notepad to write my ideas and it is very minimal as well.

## How to run in local machine

This app can be run similar to all the other basic react apps. `npm i` for installing all the dependencies then `npm start` for starting the react app at http://localhost:3000/
